The goal for this exercise is to create  some functions in a calculator that does the following:

add, subtract, get the sum, multiply, get the power, and find the factorial

In order to do this please fill out each function with your solution. Make sure to return the value so you can test it in Jasmine! To see the expected value
take a look at the spec file that houses the Jasmine test cases.
Below are my tests faileed and passed files included all tests passed.
Test passed and I ahve practiced testing with Jasmine in Javascript

Testing is to familar learner with multiple concepts with javascript. This Test process will help learner about Jasmine testing in javascript.
